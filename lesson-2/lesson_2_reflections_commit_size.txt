What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git file gets created as a directory for the metadata that runs the commits.
it also list all existing files in the directory, and it shows all files as
untracked files.

it's necessary to organize the base for the repository


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area serves as a sketching area to put files together to then make
the commit( in my case however i was not able to make the commit) The working
directory is the unique address while the repository holds all of the files.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I've learnt a lot in this exercise because  along the way i had many hurdles to
overcome. The first obstacle was setting up subl as my core editor for git.
However, after doing some research i discovered that one can also do commits in
most text editors directly from the editor. It is absolutely ground breaking for
me to be able to perform this task from inside the editor because even at this
early learning stage I presume most of the coding gets done in them.
I'm also getting a big picture of GIT. I feel more confident now making changes
and navigating in uncomfortable terrain. I feel less intimidate when in need
to venture out in the net for answers.

the diagram the way we do?
