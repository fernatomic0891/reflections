What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a .git file gets created as a directory for the metadata that runs the commits.
it also list all existing files in the directory, and it shows all files as
untracked files.

it's necessary to organize the base for the repository


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area serves as a sketching area to put files together to then make
the commit( in my case however i was not able to make the commit) The working
directory is the unique address while the repository holds all of the files.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I've learnt a lot in this exercise because  along the way i had many hurdles to
overcome. The first obstacle was setting up subl as my core editor for git.
However, after doing some research i discovered that one can also do commits in
most text editors directly from the editor. It is absolutely ground breaking for
me to be able to perform this task from inside the editor because even at this
early learning stage I presume most of the coding gets done in them.
I'm also getting a big picture of GIT. I feel more confident now making changes
and navigating in uncomfortable terrain. I feel less intimidate when in need
to venture out in the net for answers.




What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches would help a lot in the exploration of new ideas while maintaining
most of the previous work intact. I'd can also help making alternative
iterations for different purposes expanding the horizons for projects.

Useful commands:
Viewing the commit history
The full command Caroline types to see the visual representation of the commit
 history is git log --graph --oneline master coins.

Checking out the coins branch
Note that you'll need to check out the coins branch using
the command git checkout coins before you can view the coins
branch using git log.

git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was 25ede83 a couple missing ends with the ipad version
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
fernandomarroquin (master) asteroids $ git branch
* master
fernandomarroquin (master) asteroids $ git branch easy-mode
fernandomarroquin (master) asteroids $ git branch
  easy-mode
* master
fernandomarroquin (master) asteroids $ git checkout easy-mode
Switched to branch 'easy-mode'
fernandomarroquin (easy-mode) asteroids $ git branch
* easy-mode
  master



How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It help me understand the relationships between master, branches and commits.
Now i know what allows multiple collaborators to share the same project,
add new features independently and when ready fuse into a new or existing
branch. Moreover it maps out the path that every change travels, how they
get store, how to merge to an existing one to a master/branch or create a new
branch all together.

Command to create a new branch to retain the commits you create:
**** git checkout - new_branch_name****



What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches together result in an updated master/branch. It gets
represented in diagram format for easy comprehension and mapping.

ADDITIONAL NOTES ON BRANCHING:

Checking out the coins branch
you'll need to do so now with the command ***git checkout coins*** before
 you'll be able to refer to it. Once you've done that, decide whether
  you should keep it checked out or check out a different branch before
  completing the merge.

A note about git merge
git merge will also include the currently checked-out branch in the merged
version. So if you have branch1 checked out, and you run ***git merge branch2
branch3****, the merged version will combine branch1 as well as branch2 and branch3.
 That’s because the branch1 label will update after you make the merge commit,
 so it’s unlikely that you didn’t want the changes from branch1 included
 in the merge. For this reason, you should always checkout one of the two
 branches you’re planning on merging before doing the merge.
 Which one you should check out depends on which branch label you want to point
to the new commit.

Since the checked-out branch is always included in the merge, you may have
guessed that when you are merging two branches, you don't need to specify both
of them as arguments to git merge on the command line. If you want to merge
branch2 into branch1, you can simply git checkout branch1 and then type ***git
merge branch2***. The only reason to type ****git merge branch1 branch2****
is if it helps
you keep better mental track of which branches you are merging.

Also, since the two branches are merged, the order in which they are typed
into the command line does not matter. The key is to remember that git merge
always merges all the specified branches into the currently checked out branch,
creating a new commit for that branch.

Merge conflict
If you get a message like this

Auto-merging game.js
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in game.js
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
then your files were not in the same state as Caroline's when you started the
merge. To fix this, complete the following steps:
Restore your files to their state before you started the merge by
running ****git merge --abort****
Double check the state of your files. If you run ****git log**** while the
master branch
is checked out, you should see Caroline's "Add color" commit as the
second-most-recent, and the most recent should be your commit fixing the bullet
bug. If you use git diff to compare your commit to Caroline's, your commit
should introduce the line this.delayBeforeBullet = 10; on line 424. The line
should be indented to the same level as the line below it using only spaces
(no tabs), and the line should have no spaces after it.
Once your file is in the correct state, create a new commit with your changes.
Try the merge again.

Comparing a commit to its parent
The command Caroline mentions to compare a commit to its parent is
*****git show commit_id****





What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Merging automatically could be tricky if there are conflicts unresolved Because
GIT will ask you to resolve them before merging. This could be tricky and
time consuming if conflicts are difficult to find and resolved. On the other
hand my first experience with manual merging seem to be a breeze (other than
naming the merge) because I did not find any conflicts to resolve. Still I think
I need to learn a lot more about the subject.

Commands I learnt in this topic:

****git log -n 1*** shows only the most recent commits
