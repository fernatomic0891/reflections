When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

It depends on whether the project requires collaboration with teammates for
which it would be more efficient i believe to work remote. Or if you are working
offline going local might be a better option.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

pulling changes manually it's a good mental exercise to keep track of changes
made to repo rather than Github making them automatically for you. Auto mode
is definitely more convenient yet not as mentally engaging.

PULL FROM GITHUB:

***git pull repo_name branch_name***

PUSH TO GITHUB:
***git push repo_name branch_name***

***git status***
***git remote***
***git remote -v***




Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks, Clones, and Branches differ in that Branches are an extension of the
same file with added changes, Clones and Forks have the same function except
that Fork are a special feature exclusive to GitHub. I'd used forks to clone
someone else's project to maintain credit to its original author and I'd used
cloning every other situation.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

I still don't know what the benefits are? It could be that it is accessible
offline and one can accept, and modify updates at will. I'm really sure and
I think I might need more time to process this benefits.

***git mergetools***

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

I'd probably create a similar system but instead of using GitHub I'll probably
use a simpler cloud based system like dropbox or something similar. It'd be
difficult to maintain and keep up to date with so many changes and let's not
even talk about collaborating on multiple projects with many collaborators.



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

Changes could be made on a separate branch when the need to collaborate with
other people calls for interacting and agreeing on changes before commits are
added to any project.
